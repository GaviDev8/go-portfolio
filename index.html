        <div>
          <p>
            I'm a strategic professional known for fostering diverse partnerships that drive impactful results. At Alphabet Inc., I orchestrated the successful transition of Sandbox@Alphabet to an independent entity, showcasing my ability to navigate complex organizational dynamics. As lead of a Latinx Employee Resource Group, I secured executive sponsorship and expanded career development opportunities. I excel in dynamic environments, leveraging my strategic mindset to build bridges across teams. My passion for inclusive change drives me to continuously seek new opportunities. Currently, I'm pursuing a career as a full-stack developer to further broaden my skill set and contribute to transformative projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a native speaker of both Spanish and English, I'm on a journey to master French. I'm deeply passionate about real estate and take pride in being a landlord. Outside of my professional interests, you'll often find running, boxing, or spending time with my pets. If I was an emoji formula, I'd equal to  🐶 ☕ 🏃🏽‍♀️ ✈️ 😴
